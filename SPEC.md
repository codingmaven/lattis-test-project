You will implement a backend to powered mobile applications using following tools

Node.js
MySQL

All the third party frameworks are allowed. (Don’t use too much, only when it’s really needed)
You should follow RESTful principles.

Place the code on your GitHub account as a public repository.

Push your starting setup (service is running but APIs not implemented yet) to the master branch. Implement APIs in develop branch and create a PR. Select me (kabanishe23 and raverat) as reviewers.

Models

User
Id (int, autoincrement)
username
name (could be first+last name or just one of them)
password (should be encrypted and not accessible by backend APIs)
birthDate

Lock
Id (Int, autoincrement)
macId (UUID string generated by backend)
name
user (reference to the user model)

Functionality

Sign Up - create a new user with username and password
Log In - user should be able to log in using his username and password
Update user - authorized user should be able to update his name and birhtDate (PUT and PATCH should be supported)
Delete user - user should be
able to delete himself from the system
Create lock - user should be able to create a new lock providing name (duplicated lock names not allowed)
Update lock - user should be able to change the names of his locks
Delete lock - user should be able to delete his locks
Get locks - user should be able to get his locks (as list, by id, by macId)
Get users - user should be able to get other users (as list, by id, by username). locks should not be visible to other users (only authorized user can access his locks)
Get self information - user should be able to get his model by hitting simple route like /me or user/me

Optional
Having README.md file with service setup instructions is not required but would be plus. Don’t make it until you implement the service itself.
Using TDD (and covering with tests) is not required but would be plus.
If you can provide the link to the server (could be any server you have access to) with running project it would be plus.
Having auto deploy functionality is not required but would be a plus (merging/pushing code to the master should be a trigger)
